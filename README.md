# Technical Writer Assessment - Codelab Project

This repository contains the deliverables for the Technical Writer assessment. The project demonstrates the ability to create structured technical tutorials, manage code repositories with branching strategies, and analyze legacy documentation.

## 📌 Repository Structure

To reflect a real-world developer experience, this repository uses a multi-branch strategy:

* **`main`**: Contains the documentation, autonomy scenarios, and outdated fragment analysis.
* **`starter`**: Contains the initial Spring Boot project (baseline with GET endpoints).
* **`solution`**: Contains the completed project with the POST endpoint and DTOs implemented.

## 📂 Deliverables

### 1. Codelab Tutorial
Located in `/codelab/add-product-endpoint.md`. This step-by-step guide teaches developers how to implement a POST endpoint to create products in a Spring Boot REST service.

### 2. Outdated Fragment Analysis
Located in `outdated-analysis.md`. A critical review of a legacy codelab excerpt, identifying deprecated libraries (Springfox), versioning issues (Spring Boot 2.x), and modern best practices (Constructor Injection and Jakarta namespace).

### 3. Autonomy Scenarios
Located in `autonomy-answers.md`. Strategic responses to real-world technical writing challenges, such as undocumented APIs, conflicting documentation, and last-minute breaking changes.

## 🚀 How to use this Codelab

1.  **Clone the repo**: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
2.  **Start coding**: Switch to the `starter` branch to begin the tutorial.
3.  **Follow the guide**: Open the documentation in the `main` branch.
4.  **Check the result**: Compare your work with the `solution` branch if you get stuck.
